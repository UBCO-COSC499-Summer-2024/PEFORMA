### High-level project description and boundaries

Describe your MVP in a few statements and identify the boundaries of the system.

### Measurable project objectives and related success criteria (scope of project)

Make sure to use simple but precise statement of goals for the project that will be included when it the project is completed.  Rememeber that goals must be clear and measurable and **SMART**.  It should be clearly understood what success means to the project and how the success will be measured (as a high level, what is success?).

## Users, Usage Scenarios and High Level Requirements 

### Users Groups:
Provide a a descriotion of the primary users in the system and when their high-level goals are with the system (Hint: there is more than one group for most projects).  Proto-personas will help to identify user groups and their wants/needs.

### Envisioned Usage
What can the user do with your software? If there are multiple user groups, explain it from each of their perspectives. These are what we called *user scenarios* back in COSC 341. Use subsections if needed to make things more clear. Make sure you tell a full story about how the user will use your software. An MVP is a minimal and viable, so don’t go overboard with making things fancy (to claim you’ll put in a ton of extra features and not deliver in the end), and don’t focus solely on one part of your software so that the main purpose isn’t achievable. Scope wisely.  Don't forget about journey lines to describe the user scenarios.

### Requirements:
In the requirements section, make sure to clearly define/describe the **functional** requirements (what the system will do), **non-functional** requirements (performane/development), **user requirements (what the users will be able to do with the system and **technical** requirements.  These requirements will be used to develop the detailed uses in the design and form your feature list.
#### Functional Requirements:
- Describe the characteristics of the final deliverable in ordinary non-technical language
- Should be understandable to the customers
- Functional requirements are what you want the deliverable to do

#### Non-functional Requirements:
- Specify criteria that can be used to judge the final product or service that your project delivers
- List restrictions or constraints to be placed on the deliverable and how to build it; remember that this is intended to restrict the number of solutions that will meet a set of requirements.

#### User Requirements:
- Describes what the user needs to do with the system (links to FR)
- Focus is on the user experience with the system under all scenarios

#### Technical Requirements:
- These emerge from the functional requirements to answer the questions: 
-- How will the problem be solved this time and will it be solved technologically and/or procedurally? 
-- Specify how the system needs to be designed and implemented to provide required functionality and fulfill required operational characteristics.
  
## Tech Stack
Identify the “tech stack” you are using. This includes the technology the user is using to interact with your software (e.g., a web browser, an iPhone, any smartphone, etc.), the technology required to build the interface of your software, the technology required to handle the logic of your software (which may be part of the same framework as the technology for the interface), the technology required to handle any data storage, and the programming language(s) involved. You may also need to use an established API, in which case, say what that is. (Please don’t attempt to build your API in this course as you will need years of development experience to do it right.) You can explain your choices in a paragraph, in a list of bullet points, or a table. Just make sure you identify the full tech stack.
For each choice you make, provide a short justification based on the current trends in the industry. For example, don’t choose an outdated technology because you learned it in a course. Also, don’t choose a technology because one of the team members knows it well. You need to make choices that are good for the project and that meet the client’s needs, otherwise, you will be asked to change those choices.  Consider risk analysis. 

## High-level risks
Describe and analyze any risks identified or associated with the project. 

## Assumptions and constraints
What assumptions is the project team making and what are the constraints for the project?

## Summary milestone schedule

Identify the major milestones in your solution and align them to the course timeline. In particular, what will you have ready to present and/or submit for the following deadlines? List the anticipated features you will have for each milestone, and we will help you scope things out in advance and along the way. Use the table below and just fill in the appropriate text to describe what you expect to submit for each deliverable. Use the placeholder text in there to guide you on the expected length of the deliverable descriptions. You may also use bullet points to clearly identify the features associated with each milestone (which means your table will be lengthier, but that’s okay).  The dates are correct for the milestones.  

|  Milestone  | Deliverable |
| :-------------: | ------------- |
|  May 29th  | Project Plan Submission |
| May 29th  | A short video presenation decribing the user groups and requirements for the project.  This will be reviewed by your client and the team will receive feedback. |
| June 5th  | Design Submission: Same type of description here. Aim to have a design of the project and the system architecture planned out. Use cases need to be fully developed.  The general user interface design needs to be implemented by this point (mock-ups). This includes having a consistent layout, color scheme, text fonts, etc., and showing how the user will interact with the system should be demonstrated. It is crucial to show the tests pass for your system here. |
| June 5th  |  A short video presenation decribing the design for the project.  This will be reviewed by your client and the team will receive feedback. |
| June 14th  | Mini-Presentations: A short description of the parts of the envisioned usage you plan to deliver for this milestone. Should not require additional explanation beyond what was already in your envisioned usage. This description should only be a few lines of text long. Aim to have 3 features working for this milestone (e.g., user log-in with credentials and permissions counts as 1 feature). Remember that features also need to be tested.  |
| July 5th  | MVP Mini-Presentations: A short description of the parts of the envisioned usage you plan to deliver for this milestone. Should not require additional explanation beyond what was already in your envisioned usage. This description should only be a few lines of text long. Aim to have close to 50% of the features working for this milestone.  Remember that features also need to be tested. Clients will be invited to presentations.|
| July 19th  | Peer testing and feedback: Aim to have an additional two features implemented and tested **per** team member. As the software gets bigger, you will need to be more careful about planning your time for code reviews, integration, and regression testing. |
| August 2nd  | Test-O-Rama: Full scale system and user testing with everyone |
| August 9th  |  Final project submission and group presentions: Details to follow |

## Teamwork Planning and Anticipated Hurdles
Based on the teamwork icebreaker survey, talk about the different types of work involved in a software development project. Start thinking about what you are good at as a way to get to know your teammates better. At the same time, know your limits so you can identify which areas you need to learn more about. These will be different for everyone. But in the end, you all have strengths and you all have areas where you can improve. Think about what those are, and think about how you can contribute to the team project. Nobody is expected to know everything, and you will be expected to learn (just some things, not everything).
Use the table below to help line up everyone’s strengths and areas of improvement together. The table should give the reader some context and explanation about the values in your table.

For **experience** provide a description of a previous project that would be similar to the technical difficulty of this project’s proposal.  None, if nothing
For **good At**, list of skills relevant to the project that you think you are good at and can contribute to the project.  These could be soft skills, such as communication, planning, project management, and presentation.  Consider different aspects: design, coding, testing, and documentation. It is not just about the code.  You can be good at multiple things. List them all! It doesn’t mean you have to do it all.  Don’t ever leave this blank! Everyone is good at something!

|  Category  | Team Member 1 | Team Member 2 | Team Member 3 | Team Member 4 | Team Member 5 | Team Member 6 | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  **Experience**  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
|  **Good At**  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
|  **Expect to learn**  | Don’t ever leave this blank! We are all learning.  | Understanding your limits is important. Where do you expect you will need help? | It may not be technical skills. You may be a good coder but never worked with people in a team. Maybe you built a web- site but not used a framework. | It may also be a theoretical concept you already learned but never applied in practice. | Think about different project aspects: design, data security, web security, IDE tools, inte- gration testing, CICD, etc. There will be something. | Don’t ever leave this blank! We are all learning. | 

Use this opportunity to discuss with your team who **may** do what in the project. Make use of everyone’s skill set and discuss each person’s role and responsibilities by considering how everyone will contribute.  Remember to identify project work (some examples are listed below at the top of the table) and course deliverables (the bottom half of the table). You might want to change the rows depending on what suits your project and team.  Understand that no one person will own a single task.  Recall that this is just an incomplete example.  Please explain how things are assigned in the caption below the table, or put the explanation into a separate paragraph so the reader understands why things are done this way and how to interpret your table.
