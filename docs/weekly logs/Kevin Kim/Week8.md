### Weekly Goal Review
  * In this cycle, I have finisehd 4 different testing that I have implemented. At first testing was not easy to handle especially rendering mock data because somehow it kept giving me an error. However once I started to understand how it works, I worked very efficiently. I am satisfied with my workload in this cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish testing course list department view and it officially my last last part that are assigned to me for MVP. Once I finish testing, I will start working on finalizing and make our system more clean in order to present on friday.
