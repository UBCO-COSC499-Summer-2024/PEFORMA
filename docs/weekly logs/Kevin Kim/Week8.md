### Weekly Goal Review
  * In this cycle, I have finisehd my last assigned test which was course list department view and tested all the features inside the page. I also finished finalizing mvp and thanks to Subaru, helped me a lot. I really made a great progress and I feel like im ready for a mvp presentation.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * My next goal is to start working on implmenting other pages starting from instructor view. Not sure which becase me and my team needs to talk and assign the task for final product.

### Weekly Goal Review
  * In this cycle, I have finisehd 4 different testing that I have implemented. At first testing was not easy to handle especially rendering mock data because somehow it kept giving me an error. However once I started to understand how it works, I worked very efficiently. I am satisfied with my workload in this cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish testing course list department view and it officially my last last part that are assigned to me for MVP. Once I finish testing, I will start working on finalizing and make our system more clean in order to present on friday.
