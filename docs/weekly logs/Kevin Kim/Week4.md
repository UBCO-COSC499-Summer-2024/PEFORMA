### Weekly Goal Review
I completed designing UI using Figma of three different views (Instructor, Department, Admin). Im still waiting for team and client to review. Prototyping flows of the pages are completely done. From last week goal was to record previous works in clockify, and issues in github which are done too. Overall, I followed what I have planned from last cycle and tasks are all completed which I believe that I have made a great progress in this cycle!

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Record a presentation for designs
  * Edit videos into one

  * Start working on implementing FE
