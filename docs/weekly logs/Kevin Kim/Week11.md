### Weekly Goal Review
  * This week was tough for me to working on tasks because I receieved a bad news from my dad about family issue. However I was able to manage my assigned tasks and also did more than I planned. Our team found a huge problem that our system is not reusable so had a team meeting and found a solution to improve on that. I managed to finish updating ddl and dml and a new feature that user can select a term which the system will be worked based on the current term that user sets on. Also, I managed to finish working on refactoring admin views. I pretty much followed the rules of each function has one functionality and also refacotred a reusable codes. Im not sure when I can mentally recovered and fully focus on project to have better efficiency on working as before but I will finish my assigned tasks and wont affect to team progress.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Until friday, which is next cycle date, I will finish refactoring instructor view pages.
