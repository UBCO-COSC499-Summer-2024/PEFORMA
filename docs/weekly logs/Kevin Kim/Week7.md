### Weekly Goal Review
  * In week 7 second cycle, I have finished performance department view page and that is my last implementation of new pages for mvp as I assigned in. I have started testing the pages that I have implemented. Testing is a bit tricky for me to understand how to mock data, but I think I can manage it. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish course list testing
  * Start performance page testing (ins view)
