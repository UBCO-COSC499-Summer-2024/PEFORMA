### Weekly Goal Review
  * In this cycle, I was out of Canada for majority however, I kept reviewing pull requests, and I also finish half of performance department page. I think overall progress of this cycle was relax but did at least minimum.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish performance page of department view.
