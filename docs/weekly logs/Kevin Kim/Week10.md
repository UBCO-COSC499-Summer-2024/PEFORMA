### Weekly Goal Review
  * I have fixed all my parts that were having error, also finished all the testing that I have implemented. I pushed my self a lot to finish earlier because there is always an error that can happen, so trying to prevent from that. Overall, Im happy with the progress that I have made

### Next Cycle Goals
  * For the next cycle, I will start working on refactoring my codes, and if any error happens on my parts, Im willing to go fix it

### Weekly Goal Review
  * I mostly finished testing that I have implemented for this project. I still have 3 more tests to work on, however I can manage them to finish by next cycle. I didnt expect SEI data entry page should be worked on, Subaru said he will going to work on that page for full stack so I just helped him out taking frontend. I expected to finish more than 60% of the test that are assigned to me and I have finished them so I made a great progress within this cycle including helping Subaru on SEI data entry page.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * By next cycle, I am going to finish all the remaining tessting, if I finish them earlier, I will start working on refacotring codes.
