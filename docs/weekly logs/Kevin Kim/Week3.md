### Cycle Goal Review
I made a lot of progress on designing UI on Figma, still need to work on more but with learing curve, I think made a good progress overall.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish UI design as a final form
  * Help team designing database (ER diagrams)
  * Assist with the Design document
