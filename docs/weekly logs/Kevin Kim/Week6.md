### Weekly Goal Review
  * My goal was to finish performance instructor view and I manged it to finish before monday. Once I finish performance page, authentication feature was finished so I started to work on login FE which controlls the token and profileId and that was top priority because in order to retrieve based on the logged in user. Overall, I had lots of trobles with token and profileId however all the features that should done by FE is 100% done! I planned to visit my family starting from June 21 till 24th so I over worked not to slow the project down.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Until friday, I hope I could finish one of the department view page for mvp. Not sure which page I will going to work on, but I assume I can manage one page at least.
