In this short cycle, we managed two presentations with Professor and client. They both seemed to like our product which I feel like im rewarded. I have finished writing up final individual reports, I would just need to look over again make sure everything is covered.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Back to requirements gathering for my personal project
  * Explore Next.js

### P.S.
