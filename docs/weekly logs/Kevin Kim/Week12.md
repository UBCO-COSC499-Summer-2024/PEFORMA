### Weekly Goal Review
Week 12 first cycle for me was very productive. I have updated ddl and dml, implemented a missing requirements, changed exporting pdf to csv and finished refactoring all my codes and 95% done for writing comments on my codes. The only remainder file is utils.js which I would have to wait for other members finishing refactoring. I would say I am officially done for writing codes including implementation, testing, and refactoring. I wasnt expecting myself to be this productive for this project and I am proud that I have learend lots of things. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish writing comments on utils.js file, the function I refactored, start writing up the documentation.
