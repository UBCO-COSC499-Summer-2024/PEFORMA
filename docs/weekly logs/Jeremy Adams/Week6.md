### Cycle Goal Review
This week was difficult because I was dealing with technical difficulties that prevented me from starting the backend. Luckily I figured it out today (June-18) and I can start having a much more streamlined
development process. Despite the issues, however, I was still able to get done quite a lot. I worked on the front end for the login page and the dashboard, and also figured out more about tests and wrote good tests
for both those pages.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Continue working on the front end for various pages in the MVP (Edit profile, service role info, data entry, + more?)
  * Make sure to write tests for those pages, and also write some for other pages if my teammates don't end up doing it
