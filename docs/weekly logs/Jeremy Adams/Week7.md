### Cycle Goal Review
This past cycle has been very productive. I completed the front end for 3 different pages, and connected one of them to the backend. I also wrote tests for each page. 
I think the overall progress of the project has been really good.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish the assign professors modal
