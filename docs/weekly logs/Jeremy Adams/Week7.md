### Cycle Goal Review
This past cycle has been very productive. I completed the front end for 3 different pages, and connected one of them to the backend. I also wrote tests for each page. 
I think the overall progress of the project has been really good.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish the assign professors modal

### Cycle Goal Review
For this cycle I was able to complete the goal that I set out to do. It took a little bit longer than I wanted it to because of code problems but I was able to get it done today. Next cycle I think I'll be
mostly cleaning up anything that's left for the MVP.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Test the assign professors modal
  * Transfer it to other pages
  * Do whatever's left in the MVP
