### Cycle Goal Review
This cycle was very productive. Compared to last time, I didn't have quite as much to do, but I still think I accomplished a lot and managed my time effectively. Overall the MVP is basically done, and I think
we're doing a great job staying on track.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finalize the CSS for the MVP
