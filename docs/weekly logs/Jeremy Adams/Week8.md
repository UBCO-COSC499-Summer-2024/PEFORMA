### Cycle Goal Review
This cycle was very productive. Compared to last time, I didn't have quite as much to do, but I still think I accomplished a lot and managed my time effectively. Overall the MVP is basically done, and I think we're doing a great job staying on track.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finalize the CSS for the MVP

### Cycle Goal Review
This mini-cycle was very successful. On Wednesday we had a meeting discussing what we all need to do before Friday, and then we got to it. I reviewed a lot of PR's and corrected a lot of the 
CSS problems in the site. I also had to set up the new laptop I'm using so it can run the project.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Do the edit course and edit service role pages
  * Fix the remaining CSS issues (top bar being weird, icons being weird)
