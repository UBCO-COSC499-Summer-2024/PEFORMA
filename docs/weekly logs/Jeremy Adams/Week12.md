### Cycle Goal Review
This cycle was very busy! On friday we decided that we wanted to include every requirement from the email we got, so we discussed as a group how we were going to achieve that.
I made some changes to the front end for course info and role info, fixing some bugs and adding in the new data we needed. Around that time I also decided I was just going to fix the
email security myself and luckily it didn't take that long at all. I basically just encrypted the email with a specific password, sent it through the URL, then decrypted it once the user
reaches the reset page. I also made a lot of progress on all my tests and refactoring this cycle, and now I'm realllyyy close to being done. I only have like 1.5 pages left to do so I'm really
hoping I can get that done by Friday.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish testing and refactoring all my pages

### Cycle Goal Review
This mini-cycle was soooo much work. I decided to finish refactoring and testing by Friday so today (thursday) I worked for like 7 hours to finish everything. It was a lot, but I was able to accomplish my goal.
Tomorrow we have the testing event and then we're going to start our final documentation. I'm really happy to be near the end of this course and I'm proud of our team for making a decent product!

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish final documentation
