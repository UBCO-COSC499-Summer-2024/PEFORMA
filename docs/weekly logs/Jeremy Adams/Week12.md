### Cycle Goal Review
This cycle was very busy! On friday we decided that we wanted to include every requirement from the email we got, so we discussed as a group how we were going to achieve that.
I made some changes to the front end for course info and role info, fixing some bugs and adding in the new data we needed. Around that time I also decided I was just going to fix the
email security myself and luckily it didn't take that long at all. I basically just encrypted the email with a specific password, sent it through the URL, then decrypted it once the user
reaches the reset page. I also made a lot of progress on all my tests and refactoring this cycle, and now I'm realllyyy close to being done. I only have like 1.5 pages left to do so I'm really
hoping I can get that done by Friday.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish testing and refactoring all my pages
