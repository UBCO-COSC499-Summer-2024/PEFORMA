### Cycle Goal Review
This cycle was very productive. I feel like we did a really good job figuring out what everyone needs to work on almost directly after our MVP presentation.
I think I've made a good amount of progress on my tasks, despite some technical difficulties with my computer. I also did a good job staying on top of all the PR's
and reviewing them ASAP.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish the forgot password pages
  * Begin working on one of the edit pages
