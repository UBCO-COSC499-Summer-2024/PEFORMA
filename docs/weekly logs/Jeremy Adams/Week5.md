### Weekly Goal Review
Overall we made a lot of progress on the project. I integrated GitHub actions and created some test jest tests. I refactored the code and created common js files with the sidebar (Kevin created) and topbar (which I created) that can be imported by any page. I also put in a lot of time reviewing other people's code.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish the login page
  * Write at least 1 actual test that tests if an aspect of the site is working
