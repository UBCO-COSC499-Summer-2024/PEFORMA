### Cycle Goal Review
Overall we made a lot of progress on the project. I integrated GitHub actions and created some test jest tests. I refactored the code and created common js files with the sidebar (Kevin created) and topbar (which I created) that can be imported by any page. I also put in a lot of time reviewing other people's code.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish the login page
  * Write at least 1 actual test that tests if an aspect of the site is working

### Cycle  Goal Review
I reviewed A LOT of pull requests, and I think we got our development branch to a much more organized and stable place. I figured out how to write tests for front end pages, and began writing some. On thursday though
I came across an error that I got very stuck on and was not able to resolve, so if I don't fix it very soon I think I'll do any tests that I'm actually able to, and then move on to working on the actual pages because
I want to get started on that.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish the login page
  * Finish a good chunk of the front end
  * Hopefully write more tests
