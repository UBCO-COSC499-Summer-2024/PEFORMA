### Cycle Reflection
This cycle was very different for us as we were missing a core member of our team, Adams, due to a family issue. Because of this we had to pivot and take over his usual tasks in a evenly
distributed manner, which we think we did well. Putting that aside, our testing event went very well for us! Everyone seemed to like our system, and the feedback we recieved was extremely positive.
The main criticism we recieved was the difficulty people had with locating the Data Entry page. Because of this, we changed the name "Data Entry", to  "Create New Course/Role" to hopefully make it
clearer. We also added a placeholder to the Course Code input section in data entry to make things clearer. On Saturday, we had a meeting discussing the design of our system, and we realized that
we needed to make it more re-usable. So we planned out what we needed to do for that, and made very good progress on the improvement of our system.
