### Cycle Reflection
This cycle was mainly focused on fixing and updating our implementations and database schema to meet the system requirements, as well as refactoring. TA assignments 
and meeting related tables are added to the DDL and new pages like meeting management was created. We also updated the import so that importing
teaching and service role assignments are now possible. Refactoring was also a huge part of this cycle. We were making the codes more modular, easy-to-read and structured
throughout the frontend and backend files as there were many repeated blocks and features were jumbled together. We made sure functions follow the single responsibility principle.
Lots of tests were done as well to verify the validity of our code and that our code maintained its robustness despite updates to meet the system requirements.

## Next Cycle Planning

| Documentation | Zhiheng |
| Fix small bugs | Subaru |
| Finish all enhancements and fixes | Adams |
| Finish all testing | Adams |
| Documentation | Adams |
| Prepare for Peer Testing #2 | Kevin, Jeremy, Zhiheng, Subaru, Adams |

### Next Cycle Goal
Our goal for the next cycle is to wrap up programming entirely, including implementation (fixes, enhancement), tests, refactoring, and documentation and prepare for Peer Testing #2.

### Cycle Reflection

This cycle involved a lot of fixing and updating things. All members continued to work on their respective tasks (e.g. refactoring, testing, commenting, documentation), but everyone also helped fix minior issues here and there after and during our 4-hour team meeting on Thursday. During the meeting, we did a comprehensive system walk through and developed a professional questionnaire for Peer Testing #2.

## Next Cycle Planning

| Task Name             | Owner         | 
| ----------------------- | -------------- | 
| Final touch-up | Jeremy, Subaru, Adams |
| Documention | Kevin, Jeremy, Zhiheng, Subaru, Adams |
| Prepare for client demo | Kevin, Jeremy, Zhiheng, Subaru, Adams |
| Prepare for requirements review | Kevin, Jeremy, Zhiheng, Subaru, Adams |

### Next Cycle Goal

Beside some minor fixes and last-minute touch-up, we hope to finish documenting by Wednesday. Individual reports will also be worked on during this time. On Friday, we'll having a team meeting to discuss about total system features, as well as diagrams for the individual report (only discuss, we won't be actually creating the diagrams). We will also be preparing for the final presentation, client demo and requirements review.
