### Cycle Reflection

This cycle revolved around going through the system again and again, as well as re-reading the codes in detail as we 
create our individual reports and the user guide. As we went through the system, we found many things that were not 
working as intended and we made various kinds of fixes, both backend and frontend, as well as updating the initialization
sample data. The requirements review session didn't go as well as hoped. We went in with the expectation that it was gonna 
be a relaxed walk-through, but we needed some preparation and maybe a rehearsal in reality. After the initial attempt 
at requirements review, we sat down as a team and went through critical parts of our system and made sure we will be able
to present smoothly without any surprises or confusion.
