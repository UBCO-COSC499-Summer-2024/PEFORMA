### Cycle Reflection
We finished the entire implementation of the project on Wednesday and entered the phase of merging all the PRs into the development branch.
There were problems that arose when merging, such as files getting over written and the function not working properly. This was mainly because
we did not handle the merge conflicts properly and now we are fixing the issues that arose from it. Most of the errors are fixed and 
and we are now left with the small error handling and code refactoring. We are doing the tests as we refactor so we are confident that we will finish
the entire project by the final presentation date. The difficulty that we face was communication. Some members were not notified of the file
changes which ended up over writing the existing code. I guess the only way to solve this issue is be specific in what you did today. I also 
believe pair programming is another option for solving this problem. 


## Next Cycle Planning

| Task Name             | Owner         | 
| ----------------------- | -------------- | 
| FE testing   | Jeremy |
| FE Refactoring  | Kevin, Jeremy |
| BE unit test testing  | Zhiheng |
| BE integration test testing  | Adams |
| BE refactoring  | Subaru |
| Course assign modal  | Jeremy & Zhiheng |
| Service role assign modal  | Jeremy & Zhiheng |
| Department profile page assign modal | Adams |
| Fix db  | Adams |
| Integration test | Adams |
| Instructor view course list small change | Kevin |
| Create-account BE small change | Subaru |

### Next Cycle Goal
For the next cycle, we are going to finalize the product for the implementation and finish testing including unit testing and integration testing. 
We will also reflect the feedbacks from the peer testing, so the schedule is tight. But some of the FE and BE refactoring are done, and we do the testing as we refactor, so the above tasks should be doable.
