### Weekly Goal Review
I got a lot of things done this cycle, including code refactoring and the remaining BE implementation. The SEI BE was tough
because I had to make a new table in the db and reflect the changes in the related tables. 
Code refactoring was also tough because I had to look for redundant codes and make a new file if there is an overlapping codes so that
I can just import the function there. 
Our progress as a team was great this cycle because we were so devoted to complete the implementation. My task for implementation is all done
and now my job is to finish the remaining code refactoring after the BE code is merged to the development. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish remaining code refactoring for BE

### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was very chill because all of the implementation was done and we were in the process of merging all the PRs to the development branch. We encountered lots of file changes and conflicts but luckily, there was no conflicts with my PR.
The code refactoring is still in process because I was waiting for everyone to fix the issues. I will finish the rest of the code refactoring after Friday, and I am thinking it will not be much of a work because I already finished most of it. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Code refactoring
  * Fix create account
