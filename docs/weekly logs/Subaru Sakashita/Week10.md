### Weekly Goal Review
I got a lot of things done this cycle, including code refactoring and the remaining BE implementation. The SEI BE was tough
because I had to make a new table in the db and reflect the changes in the related tables. 
Code refactoring was also tough because I had to look for redundant codes and make a new file if there is an overlapping codes so that
I can just import the function there. 
Our progress as a team was great this cycle because we were so devoted to complete the implementation. My task for implementation is all done
and now my job is to finish the remaining code refactoring after the BE code is merged to the development. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish remaining code refactoring for BE
