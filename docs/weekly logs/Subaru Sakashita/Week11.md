### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was very challenging because one of our teammates was absent for a week and we had to strategically come up with a plan to make all 
adjustments by the deadline we set. I took over Zhiheng's data entry task so that he can focus on the import feature that originally was Adam's task. 
Because I had to be very efficient in what I do compared to before, I did the implementation and code refactoring at the same time. This requires understanding
other people's code smoothly and adapting to my style which was very hard at first but I got a hang of it. I will try to finish the remaining as early as possible
so that I could start working on tests and that Zhiheng can go all out on the import feature. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish remaining code refactoring for BE
