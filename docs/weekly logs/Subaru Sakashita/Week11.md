### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was very challenging because one of our teammates was absent for a week and we had to strategically come up with a plan to make all 
adjustments by the deadline we set. I took over Zhiheng's data entry task so that he can focus on the import feature that originally was Adam's task. 
Because I had to be very efficient in what I do compared to before, I did the implementation and code refactoring at the same time. This requires understanding
other people's code smoothly and adapting to my style which was very hard at first but I got a hang of it. I will try to finish the remaining as early as possible
so that I could start working on tests and that Zhiheng can go all out on the import feature. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish remaining code refactoring for BE

### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was a lot of bug fixes and code refactoring. Since Adams is not here, his tasks were difficult to refactor. 
Some bug fixes require big adjustments in the sql query so it was very tough. I still have 7 files of code refactoring but I am planning to finish them by the end of weekend. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Code refactoring
  * Bug fixes
