### Weekly Goal Review
I completed ddl creation, and db connection which is essential for everything. I had trouble with dockerizing postgres but I was able to complete through comprehensive research.
I saw many branches not being merged or reviewed so I will review them ASAP before it gets too messy. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Login
  * Logout

    </tr>
</table>

### Weekly Goal Review
I handed over login BE to Zhiheng because he was doing authentication, so it would be simple if one person does one task. \
I focused on profile BE because the priority is pulling data from database rather than manipulating. However, I got sick on Wednesday, so I could not spend much time on the actual coding. \n
It was good that I at least got the DB automatic creation and insertion done because it would be time consuming to load tables and data every time we launch docker.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Complete Instructor Profile BE
  * Complete UserProfile BE
