### Weekly Goal Review
I completed the department view performance BE which is one of the appealing features of this system. It required lots of querying, but I managed to complete efficiently using the previous codes.
I also completed servicerole info BE. It does not display the service role info based on the given service role ID because the pages are not connected yet. 
I will change the code once the necessary pages are connected.
I also finished two testing: course info BE and leaderboard in the performance page. It took me a while to learn the coding for tests but I think I got a hang of it, so the remaining tests will not take that much time.
This cycle, although I got a lot of things done, I did not commit a lot compared to other teammates in terms of the number of hours because I thought I needed to take some time to rest from overworking.
I took little break in the previous cycle but this break was something I really needed to maintain my motivation level.
I am very confident that we can finish all the MVPs by Friday because everyone is putting hard work into this project and I really appreciate working with my teammates.
The communication issue got better because I feel like compared to previous cycles, everyone is more active on discord.
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish all tests for performance BE
  * Finish service role info BE test
