### Weekly Goal Review
I completed instructor performance BE. It took a lot of time to finish because I had to query a lot and apply on each corresponding fe files.\n
The course info is also completed. I got a lot of things done this cycle as I put a lot of time on it. \n
The team kept up with the communication quality even though we did not have the chance to meet in person. I am thinking our teamwork has been \n 
strengthed from last cycle. At first I was very anxious about completing the MVP on time because other groups were way ahead than we were, but I think \n
with this much progress as a whole, I am confident that our group will finish on time. \n
There is no difficulty faced in terms of team communication for this cycle. \n
The difficulty in terms of programming is that I had to join multiple tables and be extra careful with error handling. I overcame by reading the code carefully one by one. I also had a difficulty when rebasing the most latest development branch to my own branch and I overcame by doing lots of research on git.
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Service role info BE
  * Dept view performance BE
  * Fix instructor profile querying to fit the latest version of database

### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was lots of debugging. The development branch had so many bugs to fix after merging with the old branches. One lesson I learned from this is that we need to check the development branch every time after the merge, and solve the merge conflict on vscode rather than on github.
This cycle, I did less work compared to cycle 1 because I thought I needed to take some time off as I was overworking a lot and pushing myself hard. In terms of teamwork, I kept my communication level consistent and tried to communicate a lot on discord. I also liked how everyone got together in a meeting and merged branches one by one. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish department performance BE
  * Fix instructor profile
