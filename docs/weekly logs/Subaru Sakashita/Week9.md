### Weekly Goal Review
I got a lot of things done this cycle, especially on adding new features to the existing ones. The difficulty I faced was that it was my first time touching other member's BE code 
so it took time to adapt to their code style. But I found out that their way of writing BE code was very god in terms of reusability so I will
try to refactor my code in their style as I finish up the current tasks. 
Last week cycle2, I mentioned that I will be doing the Images but Adams took over. This is because I had many tasks so he took over it,
which really helped me. The BE team is doing great in terms of amount commitments but I am a bit worried about FE because when I saw
the number of commits in insights, it was pretty uneven. I feel like we need to talk about the distributions of tasks again to solve this issue.
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish tests
  * Finish course status update

### Weekly Goal Review
I finished all the tests for what I have implemented. The performance BE test took a while because it is like several features combined into one so I had to make testing for each controller. We cooperated a lot especially on testing and making approvals so our teamwork strengthened. The difficulty that I had mentioned before was solved because everyone put lots of commitment for mvp. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish image in the profile.
