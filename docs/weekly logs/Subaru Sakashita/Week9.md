### Weekly Goal Review
I got a lot of things done this cycle, especially on adding new features to the existing ones. The difficulty I faced was that it was my first time touching other member's BE code 
so it took time to adapt to their code style. But I found out that their way of writing BE code was very god in terms of reusability so I will
try to refactor my code in their style as I finish up the current tasks. 
Last week cycle2, I mentioned that I will be doing the Images but Adams took over. This is because I had many tasks so he took over it,
which really helped me. The BE team is doing great in terms of amount commitments but I am a bit worried about FE because when I saw
the number of commits in insights, it was pretty uneven. I feel like we need to talk about the distributions of tasks again to solve this issue.
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish tests
  * Finish course status update

### Weekly Goal Review
I finished course status and intstructor teaching assignment BE. I am doing both doing implementation and code refactoring at the same time so it is taking longer than expected. But I am confident that I will finish my tasks by  Sunday that includes both refactoring and finishing up the BE. The testing was postponed because I need to refactor BE and move files to necessary folders. There was a big allocation changes to the team for example, Adams and Zhiheng became full-stack with a concentration in FE. Since we only have limited time left, I will put more hours to this project and pass this course. The difficulty I face is refactoring. Since I need to adjust the BE code to have uniformity, I need to understand their coding and functionality and adjust them which would take time but as I said before, it can be done through myself putting more hours into this project. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish Course history fixing
  * Finish create account bug fix
  * Finish refactoring
