### Weekly Goal Review
I completed instructor profile BE. It took a lot of time to learn new framework and how data flows between fe and be. After countless meetings with the teammates \
i was able to connect fe and be. Now, I'm working instructor performance be because it is part of MVP. 
One issue I encountered was the communication problem. One of my teammates changed the necessary component for login and it was so time consuming to solve.
We need to have more consistent and detailed communication so that everyone is one the same page. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Instructor Performance BE

### Weekly Goal Review
I completed the profile and the working hours for the Performance Page BE. I am going to work on the department and the leaderboard next \n
to complete the entire BE for this task. \n
One issue I encountered was how to not display the working hours for the future months. After discussions with the teammates we were able to come up with a solution that filters the months. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Complete the performance BE and start working on department view.
  * Write up unit tests in the backend
