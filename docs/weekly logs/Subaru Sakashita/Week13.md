### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was very chill because I was done with the entire impelemntation and all I had to do was showing error with specific error messages. We encountered a problem where there was a critical bug to fix but did not have time.
For that we tried to re-assign people so they can focus on the bug fix. For the next goal, we need to prepare presentation as a team. I realized that some people in our teamm do not fully know why we have the features and roles
of each user type so I guess we need to go over the system again and let them understand the functionality of the system. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish individual report
  * Presentation
