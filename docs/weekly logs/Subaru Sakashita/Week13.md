### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was very chill because I was done with the entire impelemntation and all I had to do was showing error with specific error messages. We encountered a problem where there was a critical bug to fix but did not have time.
For that we tried to re-assign people so they can focus on the bug fix. For the next goal, we need to prepare presentation as a team. I realized that some people in our teamm do not fully know why we have the features and roles
of each user type so I guess we need to go over the system again and let them understand the functionality of the system. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish individual report
  * Presentation

### Weekly Goal Review

This cycle was just writing up the individual reports and checking the system for the bugs. We also did a presentation to Scott and Raymon. We did presentation to Scott twice because we messed up the first one. This is because we did not help Kevin when he needed help when we should have. For tomorrow's presentation, I will try helping my teammates when they are stuck during the presentation.
