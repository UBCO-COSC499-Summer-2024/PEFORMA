### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was tough because the code refactoring needed to be careful because I had to move files and edit the path of the imports. 
I was able to finish refactoring a total of 103 files and they are ready for review. I still need to fix 3 files but it is just a small fix and 
I am planning to fix after the PR for code refactor is merged. 
Adams came back so we got so much things done this cycle because we needed more manpower and I am very confident that despite all of the new features 
that had to be implemented we are actually getting to the end phase of the project.
There is an issue that came up which is reviewing PRs. We have a tendency to not review the PR so it keeps piling up. I will try to review 2 PRs every day
so that we can make even better progress. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Fix small bugs
