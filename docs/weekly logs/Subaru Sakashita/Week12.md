### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was tough because the code refactoring needed to be careful because I had to move files and edit the path of the imports. 
I was able to finish refactoring a total of 103 files and they are ready for review. I still need to fix 3 files but it is just a small fix and 
I am planning to fix after the PR for code refactor is merged. 
Adams came back so we got so much things done this cycle because we needed more manpower and I am very confident that despite all of the new features 
that had to be implemented we are actually getting to the end phase of the project.
There is an issue that came up which is reviewing PRs. We have a tendency to not review the PR so it keeps piling up. I will try to review 2 PRs every day
so that we can make even better progress. 
### Next Cycle Goals
  * Fix small bugs

### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle was chill because I was already 99% done with my implementation and code refactoring. We ran a demo today and the bugs that needed to be fixed were not big so it did not take much time to fix them. I am very content with the system we have now because it is working! In the last cycle review, I brought up an issue of how PRs getting stacked. I tried to solve it but then, we encountered an issue of approved PRs not getting merged. I think the only way to solve this is to be persistent in telling the team members to approve, and merge. However, as I said, I am happy with the system we have now, and we are ready for the peer testing tomorrow. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish adding comments
  * Finish documentation
