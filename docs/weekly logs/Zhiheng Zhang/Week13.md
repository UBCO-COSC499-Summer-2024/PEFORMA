### Weekly Goal Review

Almost done with the programming part with this project, some coding work still left because when demo running our system we find new stuff to make better user experience.

Report writing is started, now cleanning up the content and can get the first draft in 1-2 days. The draft may need another 1-2 round of improve to get final version.

### Next Cycle Goals
