### Weekly Goal Review
  *  Finished and completed fixing conflicts for previous work. FE + BE for both edit page is finished, merge conflict to base branch solved.
  *  Test files for already finished re-factored BE functions start. Re-factor to test with random data to match with more general cases and less re-striction.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish up all BE tests and re-factor.
