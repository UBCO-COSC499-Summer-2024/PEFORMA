### Weekly Goal Review
Finished the Reactt front-end coding for all pages, some components are required to be added later.

Code is template only for Kevin and Jermy to work on as quick start up template, refine/more component/connection between pages required.

Sub-window pop-up is realized for all pages, UI may need adjustment but reqirement is completed.

Connection between pages is done, not all pages is connected because they are either being adjusted to match UI or the connecting process haven't reach them yet.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Checking authentication part
  * Checking data import and outport (Back end)
  * Adjust UI design (TBD)
