### Weekly Goal Review
This cycle resolved around creating the user guide for our product. I hope to have the user guide finished tonight. As I prepared the user guide, I went through the entire system and made some minor fixes. Some of my teammates have already started their individual reports and I participated in making some fixes as they went through the codes in detail.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish individual report
  * Prepare for final presentation.

### Weekly Goal Review
I finished the user guide. It's not perfect, but I believe it covers everything. I went through the system as I was making the user guide and confirm that 95% of the system works as designed. I started the individual report late, but I believe I'll be able to finish it online while upholding the quality I originally aim for. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Enjoy the freaking summer!
