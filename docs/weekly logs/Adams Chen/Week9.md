### Weekly Goal Review
I didn't complete as many tasks as I hoped. Edit profile page is being developed and I was hoping to finish it today. For profile images, they are showing in ins view course list and the topbar. Once the member list is updated, I'll also include the profile images there as well. There is a weird space between the profile image and the current view when there's a search bar in the topbar. I also need to fix the errors GitHub Actions is raising and have my PRs merged ASAP.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * #332: Edit profile page (instructor view)
  * #357: Update dept view course list BE to include all courses, not only ones in the current term

### Weekly Goal Review
I completed the user profile page and the edit profile feature, both frontend and backend. I really wanted to push myself and make it aethetic and shifted away from our team's practice to create a separate CSS file for styling. Instead, I used shadcn and Taiwind, and they work very nicely. It took a while to set up and learn. 

### Next Cycle Goals
   * #386: Change password
   * #387: Export data 
   * Wrapping up implementations for final delivery
