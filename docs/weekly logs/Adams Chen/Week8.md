### Weekly Goal Review
I completed the import feature, but it was delayed as I was running into many issues and troubleshooting took some time. The styling for the import page still needs some fixing from all the merges though. I am starting to do thorough testing for the codes I've written and will have it done by Thursday evening.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * #153: Test instructor view course list BE
  * #285: Test service role list BE
  * #286: Test Dept view course list BE
  * #287: Test import feature
  * #289: Create MVP presentation slides
