### Weekly Goal Review
I completed the import feature, but it was delayed as I was running into many issues and troubleshooting took some time. The styling for the import page still needs some fixing from all the merges though. I am starting to do thorough testing for the codes I've written and will have it done by Thursday evening.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * #153: Test instructor view course list BE
  * #285: Test service role list BE
  * #286: Test Dept view course list BE
  * #287: Test import feature
  * #289: Create MVP presentation slides

### Weekly Goal Review
I finished testing the BE code that I've written with mockup database data. However, I'm having major difficulty with querying directly from the database and plan to seek some help, then continue to work on it during the next cycle

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Possibly password reset
