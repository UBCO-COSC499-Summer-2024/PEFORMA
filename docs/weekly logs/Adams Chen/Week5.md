### Weekly Goal Review
I'm currently catching up with learning React and Express, as well as familiarizing myself with ES6+. Task breakdown between Zhiheng, Subaru and me is unclear and is the most pressing issue to be resolved so that everyone can contribute effciently.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Write up exhaustive tests for 2 features
  * Implement 2 features
  * Prepare for mini-presentation on June 14

### Weekly Goal Review
I started some backend work for course list page, but am running into issues of CORS permission. Currently, trying to resolve it by organizing code for backend properly, and not putting everything in server.js

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish BE for course list page
  * Finish BE for 2 to 3 other pages
