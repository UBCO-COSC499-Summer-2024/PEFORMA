### Weekly Goal Review
I'm currently catching up with learning React and Express, as well as familiarizing myself with ES6+. Task breakdown between Zhiheng, Subaru and me is unclear and is the most pressing issue to be resolved so that everyone can contribute effciently.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Write up exhaustive tests for 2 features
  * Implement 2 features
  * Prepare for mini-presentation on June 14
