### Weekly Goal Review
I returned from disspearing for 10 days. Since tasks were already assigned for this cycle, my main focus was to finish testing the codes I have implemented. I was able to help Kevin a little with his tasks and I was happy about that.

### Next Cycle Goals
  I hope to finish all testing, commenting and refactoring during next cycle. I also would like to do some enhancements for UI.

I completed Task A as planned, but Task B and C is taking longer than expected due to complexity in testing.
