### Weekly Goal Review
I returned from disspearing for 10 days. Since tasks were already assigned for this cycle, my main focus was to finish testing the codes I have implemented. I was able to help Kevin a little with his tasks and I was happy about that.

### Next Cycle Goals
  I hope to finish all testing, commenting and refactoring during next cycle. I also would like to do some enhancements for UI.

### Weekly Goal Review
Testing proves to still be a struggle for me as I find it very difficult to trace where the issue is being raised with the terminal error messages. I'm currently on the last part of the FE testing and will hopefully finish tomorrow. 

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Documentation
  * Client & Requirement demo preparation
