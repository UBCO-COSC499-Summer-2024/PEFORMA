### Weekly Goal Review
There were some delays, but I ended up finishing everything promised on July 16. I was pushing myself to go above and beyound with system enhancements and felt a lot pressures. After a team meeting we decided not to go with that. However, I wanted to try and ended finishing all the enhancements I said I was gonna do, alongside the tasks that were assigned to me. Overall, this was a very productive cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * #440: BE integration testing
